                        <p>A credit report is one of the best ways to get an idea of how an applicant handles their
                            financial responsibilities. This is especially important for jobs in which an employee will
                            be handing cash, sensitive financial information, funds or assets.</p>
                        <p>A credit report from ShareAble for Hires helps you evaluate how financially responsible your
                            applicant is and whether there are any warning signs in their history that should give you
                            pause.</p>
                        <p>ShareAble for Hires credit reports are delivered by TransUnion, a trusted consumer reporting
