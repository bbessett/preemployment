                <div>
                    <p>Hiring the best people for your business represents an opportunity and a risk. As a small
                        business owner or employer, it&rsquo;s important to hire those who represent the right fit
                        for your culture and can be trusted with sensitive business information. You also need to
                        feel confident in your new hire&rsquo;s ability to interact with your customers.</p>
                    <p>That&rsquo;s where ShareAble for Hires comes in. We help small business owners make better
                        hiring decisions by enabling a web-based, self-service,&nbsp;<a

                        checks.<br /><br />For small business owners, it is important to know as much as you can
                        find out about your next potential hire.&nbsp; This means reviewing relevant criminal
                        behavior and reviewing credit history too.&nbsp; <a

                            should an employer check an applicant&rsquo;s credit report?</a>&nbsp; There are many
                        reasons, including reviewing financial habits with money, financial responsibility, ability
                        to manage budgets and get more information in general to assess your risk.</p>
                    <p>We know you&rsquo;ll base your hiring decision on more than just a credit profile. But we
                        also know how risky the decision to hire an individual to assume key responsibilities can
                        be. Without an accurate background check, there&rsquo;s no way to know for sure whether the
                        job candidate is financially responsible or determine if an applicant has a <a

                    </p>
                    <p>Leveraging our state-of-the-art technology to deliver comprehensive employment background
                        checks, we designed our solution specifically for small business owners who need accurate

                    <h3>ShareAble for Hires is Convenient</h3>
                    <p>Small businesses need credit and&nbsp;<a

                            background checks</a> for open positions, but often lack a convenient way to perform
                        these employee background checks, making screening difficult. Most screening services
                        require you to go through membership before using their service. That means you need to
                        verify your business through an onsite inspection, complete paperwork, and in many cases,
                        pay additional fees before you can begin screening. Not only is this costly, but also it
                        slows down your screening process with additional steps.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, ShareAble for Hires'&nbsp;<a

                        process is self-service and accessible online immediately. To initiate the screening
                        process, you simply create an account online and use ShareAble for Hires to email your
                        applicant a screening invitation. Instead of filling out the applicant&rsquo;s data
                        yourself, the potential new hire will submit their personal information to ShareAble for
                        Hires and answer identity verification questions. Once the applicant has been verified, your
                        pre employment background check reports are made available to you and your applicant in
                        minutes.</p>

                        through ShareAble for Hires and &ldquo;push&rdquo; or &ldquo;send&rdquo; it to you.
