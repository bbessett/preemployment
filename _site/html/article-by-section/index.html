						<p>You just finished interviewing a potential new hire. The person looks good on paper and
							was even better face-to-face. Your next step should be running a background check.</p>
						<p>Background checks on job applicants is critical to you onboarding the right people. But
							the ways to go about screening a prospective employee vary in time, cost, and accuracy.
						</p>
						<p>The following guide breaks down different ways to run a pre-employment background check,
							starting with free online search results and ending with full-service, web-based
							screening from ShareAble for Hires.</p>
						<div class="subhead">Google Their Name</div>
						<p>It&rsquo;s free. It&rsquo;s fast. It&rsquo;s easy to understand why <a
								href="https://www.careerbuilder.com/advice/social-media-survey-2017">70 percent of
								employers turn to the internet</a> to dig into an applicant&rsquo;s background. With
							social media, LinkedIn profiles, and corporate websites listing employee bios, finding
							information about a potential employee can be simple.</p>
						<p><img alt=""

						</p>
						<p>But, the fastest route to checking someone&rsquo;s background can many times lead you
							down the wrong rabbit hole. A candidate&rsquo;s online information might be outdated,
							incomplete, or altogether falsified. How much can you trust the job title you found in
							an old Facebook page? Are you even looking at the right Ramesh Patel? Small businesses
							have the most to lose when relying on inaccurate background data.</p>
						<div class="subhead">Visit the Courthouse</div>
						<p><img src="/resources/preemployment/img/blogs/content/Wondering-Where-to-Get-a-Background-Check---Graphic-3.jpg"
								alt="traditional third party checks can be expensive" /></p>
						<p>When you go to a county courthouse to pull public records on a potential employee, you
							have a high chance that the records are accurate. This is a relatively inexpensive
							option for finding background information, and usually just requires you fill out an
							information-request form.</p>
						<p>A downside to this antiquated approach is that the information located in these county
							and municipal courts is limited to records within that jurisdiction. If you&rsquo;re
							trying to hire Dan Anderson in County A, they may not have records showing that Dan got
							a DUI in County B. Because local courts only return records, the info may not actually
							match your applicant.</p>
						<div class="subhead">Classic Background Check</div>
						<p>To mitigate risk, lots of employers still rely on background checks from traditional
							third-party services. These companies offer a wide variety of screening reports, as well
							as volume-based pricing which can be attractive to large companies with frequent
							screening needs.</p>
						<p>The biggest criticism of this time-tested route is its long lead time. You can spend
							weeks in limbo, waiting to receive reports. In the meantime, you&rsquo;ll need an
							on-site inspection. Pay a membership fee. The list goes on. And the longer you keep your
							candidate waiting, the more risk you take that another business hires them out from
							under you.</p>
						<p>Set aside some extra budget for hiring expenses, too&mdash;the volume-based pricing
							structures of many third-party services add up quickly. For a small business, these
							types of providers often offer more information than needed and for a higher cost, often
							making them an inefficient way to screen. &nbsp;</p>
						<div class="subhead">Online Screening in Minutes</div>
						<p>The newest kid on the background-check block isn&rsquo;t even that new
							anymore&mdash;screening a job applicant online has been happening for years. The
							practice has gained a lot of attention recently from small businesses who may not have
							HR teams and specialists.</p>

							service like ShareAble for Hires, you simply invite your job applicant to authorize your
